## Summary
Attended ICAIA Edinburgh to capture technical trends, vendor demos, and potential collaborators relevant to TRIADVORTEX INNOVATIONS product priorities for Q4. Overall themes of the conference included model provenance and auditability, domain-tuned LLMs for productisation, and latency-optimised inference for robotics.

## Key takeaways
- **Model provenance & auditability:** Strong community interest in provenance tooling and audit trails for industrial deployments - potential short-term product / prototype fit.  
- **Domain-specific LLMs:** Presentations demonstrated value in smaller, domain-tuned models for specific workflows; consider a focused internal evaluation.  
- **Edge inference advances:** New approaches to low-latency inference for robotics may influence upcoming demo specs and hardware choices.  
- **Tooling maturity:** Several open-source toolkits presented for dataset versioning and cost-estimation; these may reduce prototyping overhead.

## Contacts & follow-ups
- **Dr. Chen (research lab)** — expressed interest in collaboration on provenance tooling. **Follow-up:** share slides + one-pager; propose 20-minute call.  
- **Anita (robotics startup)** — potential demo-sharing at Jakarta conference; confirm contact and next steps by email.  
- Capture contact details and record which items need formal NDAs or follow-up emails.


## Logistics & practical notes
- Travel worked well on a tight schedule; recommend central accommodation for future conferences to maximise between-session availability.  
- Conference pacing was dense — schedule short breaks to avoid decision fatigue and maximise networking quality.
